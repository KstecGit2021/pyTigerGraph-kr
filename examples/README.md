# PyTigerGraph Examples
We broke down some examples of the usage of pyTigerGraph into the core functions and GDS functions, while also including some community projects for further inspiration. You can find these resources below.

## Core Functions
The Core Functions of pyTigerGraph have been included into one notebook found in this directory, called `pyTigerGraphCoreFunctions.ipynb`. A companion YouTube video by Dan Barkus can be found below.
